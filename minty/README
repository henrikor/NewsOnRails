MintyRails
==========

This plugin will enable Mint (http://www.haveamint.com/) support in your application.
By Tomislav Filipčić (tomislav@filipcic.com). Based on code by Graeme Mathieson.

By default it will output the mint code as if mint is installed in /mint .
This can be changed by adding the following code to your 'config/environment.rb'.
    
    MintyRails::Mint.mint_path = '/someotherpath'
    
Also, by default, it is enabled for the production environment only. To change this
add the following code to your 'config/enviroment.rb'

    MintyRails::Mint.environments = 'development'

If you want to disable the code insertion for particular pages, add the
following to the controller that don't want it:

    skip_after_filter :add_mint_code

To disable it only for some actions add the following code:

    skip_after_filter :add_mint_code, :only => [ 'login', 'authorize' ]
    
or

    skip_after_filter :add_mint_code, :except => [ 'success' ]
